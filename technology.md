# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis:
### With Google Colab, the group cleaned the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Initial patterns in the data were found using Pandas, sklearn, and MatPlot lib. 
### Replaced all classification string values into intergers. 

## Database Storage:
### Initial dataset was obtained via Kaggle. Each member holds their own copy of the csv file for now. SQL lite was used to create data tables to hold the values of our two different groups of columns; "Behavioral Factors" and "Symptomatic Factors."
### Note: Possible usage of AWS and S3 bucket might be used for data storage as we continue to explore our data for patterns. 

## Machine Learning:
### SciKitLearn is the ML library that was used to test our current dataset. The initial intent was to identify which factors provided the best level of accuracy to our model.

## Dashboard:
### We're currently not considering a dasboard yet. Beacuse our group project is still in the early stages of development.
