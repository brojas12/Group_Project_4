# Technologies Used- Data transformation and cleaning process
## Data Cleaning and Analysis:
### With Google Colab, the group cleaned the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Initial patterns in the data were found using Pandas, scikitlearn, Pyplot, SQL library for python, Tableau, Google Slides, and MatPlot lib. 
### Identified data types and descriptive statistics based on our initial observation of the data
### Encoded non interger or float datatypes.
### Data had no nulls.
### Created tables and stored data
### Visualizations were created, snapshotted, and saved for presentation.
### Dashboard created on Tableau for visualization.

## Database Storage:
### Initial dataset was obtained via Kaggle. Each member holds their own copy of the csv file for now. SQL lite was used to create data tables to hold the values of our two different groups of columns; "Behavioral Factors" and "Symptomatic Factors."
### AWS and S3 was used for data storage. URL is available in our Breast_Cancer_ML_Model.ipynb
### Images saved in our Resource folder of our GitHub.

## Machine Learning:
### SciKitLearn is the ML library that was used to test our current dataset. The initial intent was to identify which factors provided the best level of accuracy to our model.
### Testing was conducted and we have seperated possible feactures to focus on based on our dataset's heatmap created using Seaborn. 
### Matplot Library further supported the features to test.
### Classication Report and Confusion Matrix have been created to analyze the models effectiveness and proficiency. 

## Dashboard:
### Basic Dashboard was created using Tableau and our data was connected to the platform via AWS url. It looks good so far, but we will continue to work on it. 
### Google Slides was created with a overview of our project. Our goal is to use our outline to better tell the story of our project. 
#### - Note: more work needs to be placed on our visualizations per instructor. Will work on this on our last week of the project to ensure the project is literate.
