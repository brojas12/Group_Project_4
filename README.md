# Group_Project_4
### Communication Protocols:
#### Below is a set of basic guidelines for our projects workflow and the preservation of our data integrety.
##### Note: Our projects GitHub host is Bryan. While the 'square role' is changes each week, Bryan can assist with any issues that arrise later on regarding branch management. 
##### 1) Each member will work in their own branch. Code can be shared via GitHub branches or through slack. Only reviewed and finished products will be integrated by our 'square role' each week. 
##### 2) If pushing to main, advise the group via slack to ensure no overides or deleted file occur.
####	 Preferred Communication Methods:
##### 	* Slack is the main platform we will used to share and communicate ideas. Note: information can get lost in the history. Importan files should be uploaded to GitHub or kept in a back file in local repo. 
#####	* Zoom is our default video communication platform. Here we can meet "face-to-face," so to say, and for updates, discussions, and walk-throughs/ help with code related issues.
