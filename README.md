# Machine Leaning Model- Group 4- Segment 1

# Communication Protocols:

Below is a set of basic guidelines for our projects workflow and the preservation of the data's integrety.
Note: Our projects GitHub host is Bryan. While the 'square role' changes each week, Bryan can assist with any issues that arrise later on regarding branch management.


1) Each member will work in their own branch. Code can be shared via GitHub branches or through slack. Only reviewed and finished products will be integrated by our 'square role' each week.

2) If pushing to main, advise the group via slack to ensure no overides or deleted file occur.
Preferred Communication Methods:
    * Slack is the main platform we will used to share and communicate ideas. Note: information can get lost in the history. Importan files should be uploaded to GitHub or kept in a back file in local repo.
    * Zoom is our default video communication platform. Here we can meet "face-to-face," so to say, and for updates, discussions, and walk-throughs/ help with code related issues.
        "Lung Cancer: Do you have it?"
        
# Overview:

    The purpose of our machine learning model is to create an effective cancer prediction system that allows people to know
    their cancer risk status based on a number behavioral and Symptomatic risk factors. We chose this topic to create awareness
    about the dangers of lung cancer. Our goal is to enable individuals to make the appropriate decisions based on their 
    lung cancer risk status. The source data used in our machine learning model is a spreadsheet found on kaggle.com and 
    includes a total 16 columns and 310 rows. We split the data into behavioral and Symptomatic risk factors. The question 
    we hope to answer using our  machine learning model is what are the top 5 risk factors that increase the likelihood of 
    developing lung cancer?

The columns breakdown is shown below. 

### Behavioral Risk Factors:
    
    Smoking: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Peer_pressure: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Alcohol: YES=2 , NO=1
    
### Symptomatic Risk Factors:

    Gender: M(male), F(female)
    
    Age: Age of the patient
    
    Yellow fingers: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Anxiety: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Chronic Disease: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Fatigue: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Allergy: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Wheezing: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Coughing: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Shortness of Breath: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Swallowing Difficulty: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Chest pain: YES=2 , NO=1
    
    Lung Cancer: YES , NO
